# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: After shifting frantically between tabs to decide which website to use, I eventually settled on HackerRank and solved a few practice problems for Python proficiency.

**Thoughts:** I've never really coded for anything outside of academic work so, although I have taken a course on programming w/ Python, I wanted to sort of do a reset and start from the fundamentals. My goal is to turn programming into a habit, because I've got a lot of ideas that I want to actualize from the developer end and because I genuinely just think it's fun. I chose HackerRank mostly because I already had an account and, based on some reviews, it seems like a decent starting point for beginners.

### Day 1: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about list comprehensions and solved a related practice problem on HackerRank (Python)

**Thoughts**: As it turns out, it's not a good idea to code while sleep-deprived. It took me way too long to figure out the logic behind the problem, but I did learn a relatively new concept, so totally worth it!

### Day 2: August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with different approaches for "Find the Runner-Up Score" problem on HackerRank (Python)

**Thoughts**: I had some knowledge of built-in functions I could use to make things easier, but I wanted to first see how I could possibly implement it using as few built-in functions as possible. This experiment became a 1-hr replay of the ValueError: ls.remove(x): x not in list. So, yay for consistency, I guess. But I did get to concept-check lists, loops, and functions, so that was good!
